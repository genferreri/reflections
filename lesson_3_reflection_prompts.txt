When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
I would like to do so when I am working with other people on a project.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Because on doing it automatically Git might save a lot of commits instead of the once that might be helpfull for me. In this way I am the one deciding what is important and what is not.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
Fork is the copy of a given repo on github.
(to) Clone is what you do when you want/need to have a repo localy.
Branch is a side project from the master repo.
